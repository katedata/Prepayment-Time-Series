	Our time series analysis looked at the Darling Practicum Group’s data. The main goal of the Darling Group is to make a model to predict prepayment of commercial loans for small banks. The general response variable is total prepayment for a bank over time. Banks want to know what their prepayment amount is, since every dollar of prepayment negatively impacts the revenue they receive from interest in the future. The Darling time series contains quarterly information from 2003 through 2017 for six different banks. The start and end date for reporting for each bank varies with bank four having the longest reporting period. The data for this project includes the sum of all prepayments for bank four on a quarterly basis from quarter one 2003 through quarter three of 2017. We analyzed the time series of total prepayment using ARIMA, exponential smoothing, and Facebook’s Prophet. We left out the last seven time periods as our test and used the prior data for our train.
